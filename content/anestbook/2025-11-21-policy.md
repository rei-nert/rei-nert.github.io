**Privacy Policy for Anesthesia Handbook**  
Effective Date: November 21, 2025  

We at Anesthesia Handbook (“we,” “us,” or “our”) are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and protect your information when you use our mobile application (“the App”), which now includes integration with Google Sign-In, Firebase Authentication, and Firebase Analytics.

### 1. Information We Collect

When you use the App, we (or our third-party service providers) may collect the following categories of information:

#### a) Information You Provide Directly

- Google account information (when you choose to sign in with Google):
  - Full name
  - Email address
  - Google profile picture (optional)
  - Google user ID
- Firebase Authentication identifier (a unique, anonymized ID linked to your login method)

#### b) Automatically Collected Information (Firebase Analytics)

Even if you do not sign in, we anonymously collect usage data via Firebase Analytics, including:

- Device information (device model, operating system version, unique device identifiers)
- App usage data (screen views, button taps, session duration, feature usage)
- Approximate location (derived from IP address – city/country level only)
- Crash and performance logs
- Language and timezone settings

All Firebase Analytics data is anonymized or pseudonymized. We do not receive data that directly identifies you unless you are signed in.

#### c) Local Data (Still Fully Private)

As before, all patient inputs, custom drug concentrations, and clinical calculations remain 100% local on your device and are never uploaded or shared.
